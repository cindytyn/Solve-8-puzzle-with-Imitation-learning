# Folders:
* Raw_Data: Contains all raw csv files
* Dataset: Contains main train and test data that we used
* src: contains the code files for all the models and help functions

How to run code:
*	astar.py - python astar.py
*	mergcv.py - python mergecv.py (NOTE: Make sure to put data set in the same folder)
*	Rest .ipynb files can be run in jupyter notebook cell by cell or use Google Colab to run this.
